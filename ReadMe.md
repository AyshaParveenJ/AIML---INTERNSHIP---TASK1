# Task 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## Project Description

This project is a solution for the first task of an AI/ML internship. It focuses on the crucial step of **data cleaning and preprocessing**. The primary goal is to take a raw dataset, handle missing values, and prepare the data for use in a machine learning model.

The script uses several popular Python libraries to achieve this:
* **Pandas:** For efficient data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization to identify patterns and anomalies.
* **Scikit-learn:** For data preprocessing tasks like scaling numerical features.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following installed on your system:

* **Python 3.x**
* **pip** (Python's package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone [https://github.com/AyshaParveenJ/AIML---INTERNSHIP---TASK1.git](https://github.com/AyshaParveenJ/AIML---INTERNSHIP---TASK1.git)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    cd AIML---INTERNSHIP---TASK1

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    The project relies on several key Python libraries. You can install them all at once using `pip`.
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## Usage

To run the data cleaning script, simply execute the `data_cleaning.py` file from your terminal.
python data_cleaning.py
